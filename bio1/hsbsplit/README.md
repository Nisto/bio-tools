## Support ❤️

As of August 1 2025, I will be 100% out of employment, which will have a serious impact on my financial situation as well as my freedom and ability to spend as much time working on my projects, especially due to electricity bills. I don't like asking for favors or owing people anything, and will *never* turn my work into payware, but if you do appreciate this work and happen to have some funds to spare, I would greatly appreciate any and all donations. All of your contributions goes towards essential everyday expenses. Every little bit helps! Thank you ❤️
