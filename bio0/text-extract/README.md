Biohazard 0 uses custom codepoints for all characters. This is mostly an attempt at converting them to UTF-8 (as accurately as possible). However, there are some issues. It seems that somehow, the game swaps codepoints between some areas in the game. I have no idea how that works, but I've worked hard enough on this as it is already, and don't really want to spend more time on it. This was all done by painstakingly swapping the currently displayed characters via RAM and OCR-scanning screenshots. Since OCR algorithms are not perfect, I also had to make many corrections. So I kind of lost motivation to keep this going once I discovered it was flawed. It does work as intended with most files at least, and the most common versions are supported (the trial edition and the retail Japanese/US releases).
